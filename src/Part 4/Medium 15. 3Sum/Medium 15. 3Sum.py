# Time Complexity: O(N^2). Specifically, the outer loop of the nested loop iterates M times of list_of_dict_1,
#                  and the inner loop iterates a decreasing number of times
#                  for each iteration of the outer loop (but NOT M!).
#                  Though it is optimized, it is still O(M^2). In the worst case, M = N = the size of nums.
#                  As a result, the time complexity is O(N^2).

# Space Complexity: O(N). We used two constant extra dictionaries, positive_dict and negative_dict,
#                   to store the data of nums. They require space proportional to the size of
#                   the input array nums, which is N.
