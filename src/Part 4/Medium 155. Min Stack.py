# Time Complexity: O(1).
#
# Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements
#                   pushed onto the stack. This is because, in the worst-case scenario,
#                   the elements in the stack can be in non-decreasing order,
#                   which means each element pushed onto the main stack (stack)
#                   will also be pushed onto the minimum stack (min_stack).

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
