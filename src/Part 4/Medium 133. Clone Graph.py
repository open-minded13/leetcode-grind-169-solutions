# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph.
#                  If the graph is connected with no repeated edges and no self-loops,
#                  and all nodes can be visited starting from the given node,
#                  then each edge is traversed twice during the process of cloning the graph.
#                  Since there are N-1 edges in the graph, O(2*(N-1)) â‰ˆ O(N).
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the graph.
#                   This is because we use the node_mapping dictionary to store each cloned node.
