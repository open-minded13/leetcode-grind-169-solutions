# Time Complexity: O(N*L), where N is the number of strings, and
#                  L is the length of the first string in the list.
#                  This scenario occurs when the initial prefix is not
#                  significantly shortened until later strings are examined,
#                  leading to a larger number of character comparisons.
#                  For example, strs = ["long string", "long string", ...,"long string","low"]
#
#                  The best case occurs when the initial prefix is same as
#                  the string with the minimum length.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1) because the algorithm modifies the prefix in place and
#                   does not require additional storage that grows with the input size.

class FirstSolution:
    # Time Complexity: O(NlogN) + O(M*N)
    #
    # Sorting: The solution starts by sorting the array based on the length of the strings,
    #          which takes O(NlogN), where N is the number of strings.
    #
    # Finding the Prefix: For each character in the shortest string,
    #                     it checks this character against all other strings.
    #                     The complexity of this step is (M*N),
    #                     where M is the length of the shortest string.
    #
    # The approach works correctly but might not be the most efficient,
    # particularly when the array contains strings of vastly different lengths,
    # as sorting may not be necessary
