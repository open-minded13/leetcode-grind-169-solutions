# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the linked list.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1), because we only use two pointers, slow_pointer and fast_pointer,
#                   regardless of the size of the linked list. These pointers use a constant amount of space.

class Solution:
    # Two-Pointers Technique is really useful:
    #
    # 1) Middle of a Linked List:
    #    The two-pointer method is used to find the middle of a linked list.
    #    One pointer (slow_pointer) advances one node at a time,
    #    while the other pointer (fast_pointer) advances two nodes at a time.
    #    When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow pointer will be at the middle node.
    #
    # 2) Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm (Easy 141. Linked List Cycle):
    #    This algorithm is used to detect the presence of a cycle in a linked list.
    #    It also uses two pointers â€” one slow and one fast.
    #    If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to
    #    the slow pointer as they move through the list.

            fast_pointer = fast_pointer.next.next
        return slow_pointer


class First_Solution:
    # Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the linked list.
    #
    # Space Complexity: O(N), because the stack used to store the nodes of the linked list requires O(n) space.
    #
    # While this solution works, it uses additional space for the stack, which is not necessary.
    # There is a more efficient solution with constant space complexity,
    # which involves using two pointers to traverse the linked list.

        stack = []
        stack_length = 0

        middle_node = head

            middle_node = stack.pop()
