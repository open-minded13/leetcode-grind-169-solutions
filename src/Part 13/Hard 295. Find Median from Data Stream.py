# Time Complexity: O(log N), where N is the number of elements in the heap.
#                  Adding a number to a heap has a time complexity of (log N). Each call
#                  to addNum involves adding a number to a heap and possibly moving the
#                  root element (index 0) between the heaps.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements added to the MedianFinder.
#                   This is because all elements are stored within the two heaps (low
#                   and high), and the space required grows linearly with the number of
#                   elements added.
#
# Follow-Up Questions:
#
# 1) If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you
#    optimize your solution?
#
#    A: Use an array of size 101 to store the frequency of each number. The low and high
#       heaps are not needed in this case. The median can be calculated by iterating
#       over the frequency array and counting until reaching the middle. If the total
#       number of elements is odd, the median is the number at the middle index. If the
#       total number of elements is even, the median is the average of the two middle
#       numbers.
#
#       The time complexity of this approach is O(1) for adding a number and O(101) for
#       finding the median. The space complexity is O(101) for storing the frequency
#       array.
#
# 2) If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would
#    you optimize your solution?
#
#    A: Combine the frequency array approach for numbers within [0, 100] and use heaps
#       for outliers.
