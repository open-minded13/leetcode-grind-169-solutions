# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
#                  We traverse each node exactly once. During the traversal,
#                  we perform a constant amount of work for each node, such
#                  as appending its value to the result list or adding its
#                  children to the queue. Thus, the time complexity is
#                  proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the tree.
#
#                   Queue: At worst, the queue will hold all nodes at the widest
#                          level of the tree. This occurs when the tree is perfectly
#                          balanced or at its widest point, which could be up to 2/N
#                          nodes in a full binary tree.
#
#                   Result List: We also maintain a list to store the values of all
#                                nodes, which in the worst case will store N node
#                                values and Nâˆ’1 null values for leaf nodes.
