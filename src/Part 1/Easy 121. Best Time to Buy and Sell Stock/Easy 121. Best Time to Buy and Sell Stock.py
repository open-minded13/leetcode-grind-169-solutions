# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input array prices.
#                  This is because the algorithm iterates over the array once in a loop.
#                  Each iteration performs constant time operations,
#                  such as comparisons and arithmetic calculations.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm only uses a constant amount of extra space
#                   to store the maximum profit and the minimum price seen so far.
#                   Regardless of the size of the input array, the amount of memory
#                   used by the algorithm remains the same.
