# Time Complexity: O(N), where n is the length of the input strings s and t.
#                  The solution iterates over both strings once to count the frequency of characters and
#                  then checks if the character frequencies match.
# Space Complexity: O(1) because the s_letter_count list always has a fixed size of 26,
#                   representing the lowercase English letters.

    #                  The dominant factor is the sorting of both strings,
    #                  which typically has a time complexity of O(n log n).
    # Space Complexity: O(N) because the sorted versions of the input strings s and t
    #                   are stored in separate variables, and each can potentially have a length of n.
