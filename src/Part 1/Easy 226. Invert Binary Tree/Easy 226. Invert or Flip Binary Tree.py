# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the given tree.
#                  This is because the solution recursively visits each node in the tree exactly once.

# Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the recursive calls,
#                   the maximum depth of the call stack is equal to the height of the tree.
#                   Therefore, the space complexity is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion,
#                   which is the height of the tree.
#                   In the worst case, for a skewed tree, the height can be equal to the number of nodes N,
#                   resulting in a space complexity of O(N).
#                   However, for a balanced tree, the height is logarithmic in the number of nodes,
#                   resulting in a space complexity of O(log N).
#                   So, the space complexity is O(H) or O(log N), depending on the height of the tree.

# NOTE: Call Stack: When a function is called recursively,
#                   the system allocates memory on the call stack to store the function call,
#                   including its parameters, return address, and local variables.
#                   The call stack grows as new function calls are made and shrinks as the function calls return.
