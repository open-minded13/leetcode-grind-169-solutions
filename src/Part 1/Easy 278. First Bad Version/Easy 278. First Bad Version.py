# Time Complexity: O(log N), where N is the amount of all versions.
#                  In each step of the binary search, we reduce the search space by half.
#                  Therefore, it takes logarithmic time to find the first bad version.
#
# Space Complexity: O(1), since we use a constant amount of space to store variables.
#                   It does not use any data structures that depend on the input size.

# Test cases
solution = Solution()

# Test case 1: n = 5, first bad version is 4
print(solution.firstBadVersion(5))  # Output should be 4

# Test case 2: n = 10, first bad version is 4
print(solution.firstBadVersion(10))  # Output should be 4

# Test case 3: n = 1, only one version which is bad
print(solution.firstBadVersion(1))  # Output should be 1
