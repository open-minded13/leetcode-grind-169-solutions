# Date of Last Practice: Oct 30, 2023 -> Feb 2, 2024

# Time Complexity: O(N+M), where N and M are the length of the ransomNote and magazine strings respectively.

# Space Complexity: O(N). In the worst case, as the letter_counter dictionary can store
#                         at most all distinct letters from the magazine string.
