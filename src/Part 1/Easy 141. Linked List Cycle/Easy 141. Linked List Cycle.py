# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
#                  This is because the worst case of the Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm
#                  iterates all the nodes in the linked list.

# Space Complexity: O(1). This is because it uses a constant amount of additional space.
#                   The method only utilizes a few variables (fast, slow),
#                   regardless of the size of the input linked list.


from typing import Optional


# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None


# Optimized Solution: Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm uses two pointers, slow and fast.
#                     The slow pointer moves one step at a time,
#                     while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
#                     If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will
#                     eventually meet or catch up with the slow pointer
#                     within a limited number of iterations.
#                     The worst case is it iterates through all the nodes in the linked list once.

# This solution is also O(N) in time complexity and O(1) in space complexity.
# However, the solution modifies the original linked list
# by changing the next pointer of each visited node to a special "loop" node.
# This modification may have unintended side effects if the linked list is used in other parts of the program.
# Additionally, if the linked list is very long, this modification can consume a significant amount of memory.
