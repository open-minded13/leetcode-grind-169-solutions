import re

# 1. Matching Digits (\d):
#    - \d matches any single digit (0-9).
pattern = r"\d"

# 2. Matching Word Characters (\w = [a-zA-Z0-9_]):
#    - \w matches any word character, which includes letters, digits, and underscore.
#    - The \w token does not include some characters that are valid in
#      the local part of email addresses, such as the period ., plus +, percent %, and hyphen -.
pattern = r"\w"

# 3. Matching White Space (\s):
#    - \s matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
pattern = r"\s"

# 4. Matching Email Addresses (Basic):
#    - [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+ matches the username part of the email address.
#    - @[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+ matches the @ symbol and the domain name.
#    - \.[a-zA-Z]{2,} matches the top-level domain (TLD) with at least two characters.
pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9_.%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"

# 5. Matching URLs (Basic):
#    - (https?|ftp):// matches either "http", "https", or "ftp".
#    - https?: The s is made optional by the ? quantifier,
#      which means the s can appear zero or one time.
#      This allows the pattern to match both "http" and "https".
#    - [^\s/$.?#]: It matches any character that is not a whitespace, /, $, ., ?, or #.
#                  Take https://www.example.com, it matches the first character of
#                  www.example.com, which is w.
#    - .: It matches any character (except newline).
#    - [^\s]*: Matches zero or more characters that are not whitespaces.
#              The * quantifier matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character class.
pattern = r"(https?|ftp)://[^\s/$.?#].[^\s]*"

# 6. Matching Dates (MM/DD/YYYY format):
#    - ^ matches the start of the string.
#    - (0[1-9]|1[0-2]) matches the month in MM format (01-12).
#    - / matches the separator between month and day.
#    - (0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01]) matches the day in DD format (01-31).
#    - / matches the separator between day and year.
#    - \d{4} matches the year in YYYY format (e.g., 2023).
#    - $ matches the end of the string.
#    - For example, without ^ and $, the regex would match 12/25/2023 in the string
#      "Christmas is on 12/25/2023 this year", but with them,
#      it would not match because the date is not the entire string.
#    - (?:...): This is a non-capturing group only needed for findall, match, and search.
#      It groups part of the regex without capturing it separately.
#      By using (?:...) around the month and day parts,
#      you ensure that they are included in the overall match
#      but not captured as separate groups.
pattern = r"(0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[01])/(\d{4})"  # Output: [('12', '25', '2023')]
pattern = (
    r"(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(?:0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/\d{4}"  # Output: ['12/25/2023']
)

# 7. Matching Phone Numbers (U.S.):
#    - \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4} matches the format XXX-XXX-XXXX for U.S. phone numbers.
pattern = r"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}"

# 8. Matching HTML Tags (Basic):
#    - <[^>]+> matches any HTML tag, including its attributes.
#    - The + quantifier means one or more times, whereas the * quantifier means zero or more times.
pattern = r"<[^>]+>"

# 9. Matching IPv4 Addresses:
#    - (\d{1,3}\.){3} matches the first three parts of the IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.).
#    - \d{1,3} matches the last part of the IPv4 address (e.g., 1).
pattern = r"(\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}"

# 10. Matching Zip Codes (U.S.):
#     - \d{5} matches the five-digit ZIP code.
#     - (-\d{4})? makes the last four digits optional (ZIP+4 format).
pattern = r"\d{5}(-\d{4})?"
