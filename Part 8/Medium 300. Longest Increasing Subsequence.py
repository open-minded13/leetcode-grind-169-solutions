# Time Complexity: O(N * log(N)), where N is the number of elements in the given list.
#                  The time complexity is dominated by the binary search operation
#                  inside the loop that iterates through the elements of the list.
#
# Space Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the given list.
#                   The space complexity is due to the list `subsequence_tails` that
#                   stores the smallest tail of increasing subsequences.
