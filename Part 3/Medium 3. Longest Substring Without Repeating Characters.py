# Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input string s.
#
# Space Complexity: O(min(N, M)), where n is the length of the input string s,
#                   and m is the size of the character set (number of distinct
#                   characters in the string). In the worst case, when all characters
#                   are distinct, the space complexity is O(N) because we store all
#                   characters in the recent_char_index. However, when the string
#                   contains a limited character set, the space complexity is limited to
#                   O(M).
